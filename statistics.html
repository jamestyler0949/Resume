      Below are examples of coding projects I've headed. <br />
      For many projects I worked on, I did not own the rights to the data I worked with. In some of these cases, publications are still
      being sought. For these and other legal reasons, while the relevant jpynb notebooks will be available, the data utilized in such will
       not be available. However, sources will be given, and you may reach out to others to obtain such. Specifically, my work with
       Dr. Hansen's Agricultural Water Saturation Project is still seeking publication of the relevant Data Analysis. <br/>
       Its well known that much of the problem with studying Data Analysis is finding relevant research. In my studies, I found
       the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Sleuth-Course-Methods-Analysis/dp/1133490670/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1VK8RL45MHSFM&keywords=the+statistical+sleuth+3rd+edition&qid=1674062167&s=books&sprefix=the+statistical+sleuth+3rd+edition%2Cstripbooks%2C131&sr=1-1">The Statistical Sleuth</a>
       to be an invaluable resource. It is light on Mathematical formula, but in depth with logical procedure, and comes with many 
       extremely helpful data sets, along with exercises on these sets. I would recommend pairing it with the Python libraries "Scipy Stats"
       and "Statsmodels.api". Many of my relevant Data Analysis projects are taken from these data sets. <br/>
