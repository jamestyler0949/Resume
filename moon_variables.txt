Moon Data Variable Explanations:
All Data, where applicable, was of the initial measurements before treatment, except for the response variable (BDOM/t28).
This is because we wanted to use this as a predictor mechanism (and in application, we can assess treatment, but not response optical properties).

TRIAL:
Season during which the sample was taken. 1 = Spring, 2 = Summer.

TREATMENT:
The method with which the water sample was treated during the experiment.
1 = CL, 2 = CD, 3=NL, 4 = ND (Control/Nutrient, Light/Dark)

FI: Fluorescence Index (Optical)
BIX/HIX: Other Indices (Optical)
ABS254: Absorbance at 254 nano-meters (Optical)

Burn: The Burn level of the soil where the water sample was taken. (1 is burned, 0 is not burned)

Precipitation: Average Monthly Precipitation over the previous year.
Drainage: Site-Specific Data, drainage measurement.
Forest: Forestation Percentage of the land.
Elevation: Elevation of the land at the specific site.
Development: Percentage of land that was considered "developed".
Impervious: Percentage of land that was considered impervious to fire (stone/concrete, etc).
Herb Land: Percentage of land that was considered herbacious, but not forested.
Slope: Angle of slope of the land (on average) that drained into the water source.

t0: Initial measurement of carbon.
t28: Measurement of carbon post treatment. 
bdom: Measure of change between t0 and t28 (percentage).
